# Silk Library

## Project Overview

This is a reimplementation for Silk in Kotlin. Silk is an easy-to-learn minimal language which supports compile-run

The Kotlin version is actually a rewrite of the C-Sharp version [here](https://github.com/SoftCircuits/Silk/).

Most of the rewritten code is generated by ChatGPT, which lowers the time cost and complexity.

## Original Overview

> The Simple Interpreted Language Kit (SILK) is a .NET class library that makes it easy to add scripting and automation
> to your .NET applications.
>
> The library includes three main components. A compiler, a compiled program, and a runtime. The compiler compiles the
> Silk source code to bytecode. This allows faster execution and also catches all source code syntax errors before running
> the Silk program.
>
> The compiler produces a compiled program. A compiled program can be saved to a file, and later read from a file. This
> allows you to load and run a Silk program without recompiling it each time.
>
> Finally, the runtime component executes a compiled program.
>
> The main power of this library is that it allows you to register your own functions and variables with the compiler and
> those functions and variables can be called from the Silk program. When one of your registered functions is called,
> the `Function` event is raised, allowing the host application to provide key functionality specific to the host
> application's domain.
>
> The Silk language itself is designed to be relatively easy to learn. It has no semicolons or other excessive
> punctuation, and the language is not case-sensitive.
>
> This project includes both the class library (Silk), and a test project/solution (TestSilk). If you download everything
> and run it, it will run the TestSilk application. You just need the class library to include Silk in your own projects.
